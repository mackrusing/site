Welcome! I'm Mack Rusing (*he/him*), a 17-year-old web & software developer currently living in Phoenix, Arizona.

I consider myself a full-stack developer, but I tend to concentrate more on server-side projects. Currently, I am focusing on API development with Express. You can check out all of my projects on <InlineLink href="https://github.com/mackrusing">Github</InlineLink>

## Experience
As mentioned above, I am a web & software developer. I am proficient in TypeScript (including JavaScript), Python, Sass (including CSS), and HTML. I also have experience in Java and Rust.

Recently, I created a full-stack TypeScript application for an event at the 2023 FBLA National Leadership Conference. The application provides a REST API and front-end web app for students to track involvement in school events. The project is not huge in scope but it demonstrates my capabilities in a wide range of web development. Feel free to check it out <InlineLink href="https://github.com/mackrusing/activity-tracker">here</InlineLink>

TypeScript is currently my language of choice, but as I learn Rust in my spare time I hope to be creating more stuff with it soon.
